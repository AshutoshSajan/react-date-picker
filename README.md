# React Date Picker

![Date picker](./public/datePicker.png "React date picker")


## Installation

### The package can be installed via NPM:

```
npm install react-datepicker --save

```

You’ll need to install React and PropTypes separately since those dependencies aren’t included in the package.


```js
import React from "react";
import DatePicker from "my-react-date-picker";

import "my-react-date-picker/dist/react-datepicker.css";

```
